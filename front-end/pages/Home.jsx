				<h3>Today, I will be telling you how to catch Gyrados.</h3>
				<p>
					Currently I go to Darmouth. And if you didn't know, there are a{' '}
					<i>bunch</i> of Gyradoses here. They are all super duper.
					Sometimes I get the intrusive thought to just chase one and try to
					catch it and see what it does. Can you imagine being a Gyrados? Do
					Gyradoses have some knowledge of how big they are? They are{' '}
					<b>ginormous</b>. But like from there POV they're probably just roaming a
					world of Magikarp, right? Like to them it's normal for a Magikarp to be
					ginormous or for an ant to be like bigger relatively than it is to us.
					Kinda crazy.
				</p>
				<p>
					Anyways, here's some of my top tier Gyradoses. I'm just realizing that
					some of these are actually Magikarp. However whatever, I already got
					the images for them and made this site so I don't really feel like
					changing it now. If you're a Pokemon person who is reading this,
					I'm sorry for my rodent ignorance.
